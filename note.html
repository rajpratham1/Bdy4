            It's amazing how fast time flies when I'm with you. Writing this note feels like adding another chapter to our incredible story. I hope you're enjoying this little trip down memory lane as much as I enjoyed creating it for you.

            You fill my life with so much color and warmth. Thank you for being the most wonderful partner anyone could ask for. Every day with you is a gift, and I look forward to all the adventures yet to come.
        </p>

        <p class="note-signature">- Forever yours</p>
